## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

# Sarah's Response
## Looking forward to your the teams feedback.


## My thought process:
1) Think on the implementation based on reusability (compomnents), maitainance and ease of use.
2) Think of the navigation and UI aspect(colors, text, etc)
3) The logic behind the implementation based on the requirements(easy, medium, hard levels) and the returned payload from getCategories.
4) Can discus more

## This was some what fun, thanks.

Sarah.
